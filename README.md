# Cornell ECE 4760 Final Project

Here is the codebase for Sam & Craig's ECE 4760 final project. The idea was to use a [32x32 RGB Led matrix](http://www.adafruit.com/products/2026) to create a full featured wall clock.

## MatrixClock

This is the main MPLABX project.

## Py-Time

This holds a simple python script to perform serial communications with the matrix. Currently it only supports setting the time on the matrix.

## bdf2hex

A helpful python script that was used to convert a 4x6 bdf font to a format usable by the matrix.
